# Binary_search
Overview
This repository contains a simple implementation of the binary search algorithm in the C programming language. Binary search is an efficient searching algorithm used to find a specific element in a sorted array. This program demonstrates how to perform binary search on an integer array and includes a user-friendly interface for input and result display.

Features
Binary Search Algorithm: This program uses the binary search algorithm to efficiently locate a target element in a sorted array.
User Input: The program prompts the user to enter the target element.
Result Display: After executing the binary search, the program provides clear feedback, indicating whether the target element was found and its index if found.
